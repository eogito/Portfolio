    <p class="about-me">
      My name is Glen Lin. I am a grade 10 student at William Lyon Mackenzie C.I. This is my portfolio website for the ICS4UO course. My interests include math, chess, watching anime, malding over coding problems and more. Recently I&#39;ve been interested in web/app development because creating websites and programs sounded cool and could bring a lot more than just doing a coding competition. I also enjoy playing chess, mainly chess puzzles <s>because I&#39;m too bad to play an actual game </s>. Outside of academics, I enjoy watching anime (my favourite is Mob Pshyco 100) and reading. I also love listening to music, both to help me focus while working and to just relax. My favourite genres are 2010&#39;s Pop and game BGMs. On this website, you&#39;ll find some projects that I&#39;ve worked on and some tutorials about the topics covered in AP ICS. Thanks for visiting my portfolio!

    <p class="about-me">
      I started coding in around grade 6. My first language was Java and at that time, I didn’t really like coding. After taking a couple of lessons, I stopped for a while. Then I started to code again in grade 9. This is when I first discovered competitive coding and the CCC. Competitive coding has always been fun for me because it’s similar to a logic puzzle. The main difference is that you can get stuck on a single part with no clues for the solution. I also took my first CCC that year, getting a 47 on Junior. This was when I switched to C++ since Java was getting slow. As I did more coding over the year, I started to get interested in web dev. I started by learning basic languages like HTML and CSS. Now, I’m interested in software-dev an I’m always out to learn more.
